#### I am currently a Postdoc Research Associate in the VADER lab with the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, and I am supervised by Dr. Ross Maciejewski. I received my Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering under the supervision of Dr. David S. Ebert. My broad research interests include visual analytics, information visualization, human-computer interaction, and applied artificial intelligence and machine learning.

          <b>MetricsVis: A Visual Analytics System for Evaluating Employee Performance in Public Safety Agencies</b><br/>
          MetricsVis is a visual analytics system that supports multi-attributes and multi-level data exploration. The system is designed for managers and supervisors who want to assess employee performance to improve the productivity of an organization. The users can compare the individual performance by inspecting multiple task categories, as well as aggregation of group performance and organizational performance.

          <b>FeatureExplorer: Interactive Feature Selection and Exploration of Regression Models for Hyperspectral Images</b><br/>
          FeatureExplorer is a visual analytics system that supports the dynamic evaluation of regression models and identification of key features through the interactive selection of features in high-dimensional feature spaces typical of hyperspectral images. We collaborated with remote sensing experts and plant science to predict the plant biomass using hyperspectral features. The interactive system allows domain experts to iteratively refine and diagnose the model by selecting features based on their domain knowledge, interchangeable (correlated) features, feature importance, and the resulting model performance.
