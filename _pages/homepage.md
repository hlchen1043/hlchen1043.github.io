#### I am a post doctoral research assistant in CART Lab, Purdue Civil Engineering. I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Information Technology. My primary research interests lie in Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV), focus mainly on perception, planning, cybersecurity and CAV in relation with homeland security. I am in charge of the testing vehicle in CART Lab, in which we have several connected, automated vehicle demonstrations. Check out our lab's vehicle [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CARTLab/research/facilities), and our story on CoE [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/News/Spotlights/2022/2022-0722-ce-feng). I also deploy and developed the raw data level fusion for cooperative perception in [CARMA system](https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/CARMA), which works with downstream application like traffic signal control.

          <b>MetricsVis: A Visual Analytics System for Evaluating Employee Performance in Public Safety Agencies</b><br/>
          MetricsVis is a visual analytics system that supports multi-attributes and multi-level data exploration. The system is designed for managers and supervisors who want to assess employee performance to improve the productivity of an organization. The users can compare the individual performance by inspecting multiple task categories, as well as aggregation of group performance and organizational performance.

          <b>FeatureExplorer: Interactive Feature Selection and Exploration of Regression Models for Hyperspectral Images</b><br/>
          FeatureExplorer is a visual analytics system that supports the dynamic evaluation of regression models and identification of key features through the interactive selection of features in high-dimensional feature spaces typical of hyperspectral images. We collaborated with remote sensing experts and plant science to predict the plant biomass using hyperspectral features. The interactive system allows domain experts to iteratively refine and diagnose the model by selecting features based on their domain knowledge, interchangeable (correlated) features, feature importance, and the resulting model performance.
