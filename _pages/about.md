<!-- I am currently a Postdoc Research Associate in the [VADER lab](https://vader.lab.asu.edu/#/) with the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) at Arizona State University. I worked with my postdoctoral advisor [Prof. Ross Maciejewski](http://rmaciejewski.faculty.asu.edu/) in the Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) - a Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence. In my recent research, I have been focusing on developing visual analytics systems that can assist domain experts in tackling real-world problems. In addition, I am also interested in conducting more rigorous experiments to understand how to promote appropriate trust in human-AI teaming environments, which can bring new insights to optimize human-AI teaming performance. I received a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in May 2020 from Purdue University. I worked with my advisor [Prof. David Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd) at [Purdue/DHS Visual Analytics Center of Excellence](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/). My primary research interests lie in visual analytics, information visualization, human-computer interaction, and applied artificial intelligence and machine learning. Previously, I received a master's degree in Computer Science in 2013 from Tufts University. During my master's study, I worked with [Prof. Remco Chang](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~remco/) to understand the searching behavior based on interaction event logs. -->

Hello, world!

I am a post doctoral research assistant in CART Lab, Purdue Civil Engineering. I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Information Technology. My primary research interests lie in Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV), focus mainly on perception, planning, cybersecurity and CAV in relation with homeland security. I am in charge of the testing vehicle in CART Lab, in which we have several connected, automated vehicle demonstrations.

Check out our lab's vehicle [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CARTLab/research/facilities), and our story on CoE [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/News/Spotlights/2022/2022-0722-ce-feng)

I've also implemented the CARMA co-simulation platform for CART lab. Customized modification regarding our research need is done by me for realistic online perception and vehicle kinematics co-simulation with microscopic level traffic simulation
