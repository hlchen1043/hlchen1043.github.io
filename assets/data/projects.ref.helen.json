//       "abstract": "<a href=https://www.purdue.edu/terra/>Terra project</a> is a collaboration among engineers and plant scientists to create a high-throughput automated phenotyping platform using either UVAs or trucks. The platform integrates multiple sensors (e.g., LiDAR, hyperspectral cameras, thermal cameras) to predict the phenotypic traits of crops. Our mission, as data visualization experts, is assisting the exploration of collected sensor data, measured ground truth plat traits, and present the connection among datasets. We created a visual analytics system, <b>FeatureExplorer</b>, that integrated the feature engineering pipeline of remote sensing experts to facilitate the selection of hyperspectral features in plant biomass prediction.

We adopted a set of hybrid evaluation metrics that considers both quantitative measures of employee achievements and subjective weighting of contribution to an organization. Additionally, customized visual representations are designed to display the performance for individuals, teams, and the organization regarding the organizational hierarchy.",

//       "abstract": "Displaying several routes simultaneously on a geographic map while preserving the geo-locations, identities, directionality, and volume of individual routes is challenging. We present route packing, a novel (geo)visualization technique collects variable-width route lines side by side while minimizing crossings, encodes them with categorical colors, and decorates them with glyphs to show their directions. Furthermore, nodes representing sources and sinks use glyphs to indicate whether routes stop at the node or merely pass through it. We conducted a crowd-sourced user study investigating route tracing performance with road networks visualized using our route packing technique. Our findings highlight the visual parameters under which the technique yields optimal performance.",

Simulations are feasible approaches to prepare us for server scenarios when real-world exercises are costly and dangerous. We create VASA, a visual analytics platform consisting of a workbench, that connects several distributed simulation components for modeling the impact of societal threats. Each component encapsulates a high-fidelity simulation model that together form an asynchronous simulation pipeline: a system of systems of individual simulations with a common data and parameter exchange format. VASA also supports coarse local approximations while high precision simuation takes long computation time. ",
